# More functions, more nested loops

#### Technologies used

-----------------

1. C files are compiled using `gcc`
2. C files are written according to the C90 standard
3. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

The following table contains files, as well as their descriptions.

| **Files** | **Description** |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `0-isupper.c` | function that checks for uppercase character |
| `1-isdigit.c` | function that checks for a digit (0 through 9) |
| `2-mul.c` | function that multiplies two integers |
| `3-print_numbers.c` | function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line |
| `6-print_line.c` | function that draws a straight line in the terminal |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal |
| `8-print_square.c` | function that prints a square, followed by a new line |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line |

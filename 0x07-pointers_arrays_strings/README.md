## More pointers, pointers to pointers,  arrays, arrays to arrays

This directory I tend to explore the beautiful world of pointers. And as a start delve into pointers to pointers(double pointers). Double pointers are pointers that point to a pointer. One has to note however it does not point to the value of the variable which the first pointer points to.

There is also multidimensional arrays. Arrays can be multidimensional  however mostly the 2D arrays are the ones I seek to explore.
The syntax for declaration of multidimensional arrays is:

										type arrayName[size1][size2]...[sizeN];

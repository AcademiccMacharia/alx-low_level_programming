# C - Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. This repository seeks to explore bit manipulation.

| **Files** | **Description** |
| --------- | --------- |
| `0-binary_to_uint.c` | function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int` |
| `1-print_binary.c` | function that prints the binary representation of a number |
| `2-get_bit.c` |  function that returns the value of a bit at a given index |
| `3-set_bit.c` | function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index |
| `4-clear_bit.c` | function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index |
| `5-flip_bits.c` | function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another |
| `100-get_endianness.c` | function that checks the endianness |

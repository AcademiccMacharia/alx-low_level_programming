### C-Dynamic Linking

-------

Dynamic or shared libraries consist of separate files containing separate pieces of object code. These files are dynamically linked together to form a single piece of object code. They are stored in the memory and accessed via their addresses. Dynamic libraries are saved using:
			Windows - .dll(Dynamic link library)
			Linux - .so(Shared object)

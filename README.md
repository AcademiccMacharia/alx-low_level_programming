### About

- Tested on `Ubuntu LTS 20.04`
- C Files are written according to the `C90` standard
- C files are compiled using `gcc`

--------

This is a repository that delves into low_level_programming using the `C language`. From the basic C commands to its algorithms and data structures, they are all covered in this repository in specific directories.

Each directory in the repository seeks to cover a particular area of `C` in depth. A further description of what each directory contains will be given below in a table. 

Well then, feel free to check out the directories and see how **LOW** you can go.✔️
